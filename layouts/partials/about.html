                <p>I'm a technology leader with <strong>two decades of experience</strong> scaling platforms and engineering organizations from idea validation prototype to series A company.</p>
                
                <p>I specialize in solving complex frontend and backend challenges, leading cross-functional teams, and mentoring engineers into leaders. My superpower? <strong>Turning ambiguity into velocityâ€”without burning out the team.</strong></p>
                
                <p>My core strengths include agile execution, ROI-driven tech strategy, systems architecture, DevOps, security, and data/AI infrastructure. I believe in building teams through mentorship and creating cultures that enable sustainable growth.</p>
